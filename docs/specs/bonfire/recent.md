## Definitions

Let the keywords that follow be case insensitive unless otherwise specified. 

- Let the keywords **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, and **MAY** (and lowercase equivalents) be defined as specified in [RFC:2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119)
- Let `incorrect` mean MUST NOT; as in, incorrect behaviour violates the standard.
- Let `i<int>` represent 2^int-1. Some examples (and the important ones) are as follows;
    - `i6` equals `63`
    - `i8` equals `255`
    - `i16` equals `65,535`
    - `i32` equals `2,147,483,647`
    - `i64` equals approximately `1.844674407×10¹⁹`
- Let `YAML`, or `Object` represent one YAML file (or "file" part of a stream), and any nested objects. Let this not exceed the maximum status characters of an i16. I validated my YAML with [This YAML validator](https://yamlchecker.com/)
- Let `packet` represent one YAML Object sent between a client-server, or server-server relationship. 
- Let `snake_case` and `snake case` mean the naming scheme where multiple words are written in all lowercase and are seperated with underscores.
- Let `GUID` and `UUID` represent a [Universally Unique Identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier). 
- Let `snowflake` represent one GUID. 
- Let the character sets `reserved`, `escaped`, `delims`, `unwise`, `lowalpha`, `upalpha`, `alpha`, `digit`, `alphanum`, `mark` and `unreserved` are to be defined as in [RFC:2396](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt). This is only when these keywords are in reference to a **character set**.
- Let `inalpha` represent the character set including `upalpha` and `lowalpha`, where no distinction is made between uppercase and lowercase. ("A" is the same as "a").
- Let the character set `safe` be the culmination of `inalpha` and `digit` and the characters `_` and `-`. 
- Let **Edition** mean the anual revision to the specification.

## Design Philosophy 

*Some of the following definitions are from [ariadne.space's post on ActivityPub's design falings](https://ariadne.space/2019/01/07/activitypub-the-worse-is-better-approach-to-federated-social-networking/).

- **Simplicity**: The standard and protocol should be simple to implement.
- **Cleanliness**: The standard must be clean and easily usable from a end-user perspective. It is more important for it to be clean and simple for end-users than the backend implementation. 
- **Correctness**: All packets and URI's must be verifiably correct or incorrect. It is considered incorrect if it is ever unclear.
- **Safety**: The standard and protocol is designed in a way that is safe, any unsafe implementations are considered incorrect. 
- **Completeness**: The standard and protocol must cover all expected situations, including future reivions.
- **Privacy**: All content should be encrypted and sent through secure channels. It is considered incorrect to send unencrypted data with the exception of pre-written public HTML pages (which are only a should not). 
- **Prevent Consolidation**: We don't want this to end up like email, where you *can* self host and join a smaller provider, but good luck with all the limitations in place.

Other, smaller goals are to make it extensible so at no point will there ever be breaking changes (No "bonfire 2.0"). While we cannot guarantee this, a finished 1.0 spec should be backwards compatible for at least the next 30 years, while still being able to add support for new features. 

## Protocol

This section defines the way bonfire protocol communicates.

### Ports and process

The uri sceheme uses the ports `:9870` -- `:9879`. 

- Port `:9870` is responseable for coordinating session-level things such as encryption, and automated content delivery such as "there is a new message in this channel", but contains no information about the message itself. 
- Port `:9871` through `:9878` are reserved for sending text messages in multiple channels at a time, where a single port cannot recevie enough data simulataniously. 
- Port `:9879` is reserved for voice and video communications. 

Establishing communications, using (our current name: OpenChatProtocol) and contuning communications, follows the following steps in order.

1. Complete TLS Handshake
    - **CLIENT:** I would like an encerypted channel. Here are my TLS/SSL versions
    - **SERVER:** Thanks for the request, I would like to use this version of TLS, now heres my certificate with my public key.
    - **CLIENT:** Verifies certificate, extracts public key, and encrypts a new "pre-master key"
    - **SERVER:** Server decrypts pre-master key
    - **BOTH:** Computes a shared secret key, called a "shared secret"
    - **CLIENT:** Sends verification message that basically says "Hey this is encrypted with our shared secret, decrypt it and let me know if its correct!"
    - **CLIENT:** Sends verification message that basically says "Hey this is encrypted with our shared secret, decrypt it and let me know if its correct!"
    - **BOTH:** Now use shared secret to encrypt communications for the remainder of the session.
2. establish edition
    - Send a CSV document with the versions you are willing to use. See Edition Agreement in Objects for details
    - Server confirms they are able to use one of your versions, and says which ones they are able to use.
    - Now the client uses whatever version they want that the server can use.
3. Main Loop
    - Server/Peer sends desired data
    - Send back data
4. Close Channel

### URI Scheme

The `bonfire://` URI scheme is motivated by the desire to have a clean inter-instance and inter-client way to denote various locations. This does not need to denote actions as those are sent in **packets** instead. However, they can include links *to* actions like joining a hub or being an invite. 

As a general rule, it follows the sceme `bonfire://guid` scheme. 

Examples: 

```plaintext
View a users profile: 
bonfire://@username@instance.tld  -- Can change if they change thier username
bonfire://d1cp:e0fg:ms56:wf2a:ygkd:fveb:82  - Cannot change

View a channel: 
bonfire://d1cp:e0fg:ms56:wf2a:ygkd:fveb:82

View a specific message: 
bonfire://d1cp:e0fg:ms56:wf2a:ygkd:fveb:82
```


## Objects

Objects are just how we send data between clients. It can be stored in any format, or translated to other formats to allow for interoperability.

All objects MUST have a data header which specifies the edition which is required to handle the communication properly, and the type of communication.

```yaml
edition: 2023   # Not necesary if you have agreed to talk over only one edition.
type: message
operation: GET  # Not technechally needed, as it is the default operation. 
```

If an object fails the signature check, dosen't contain a heder or all needed data, or the user dosen't have permissions for that, you can either simply DROP the pakcet or send a an ERROR response.

### Verify encryption is working.

To ensure the server knows exactly what to expect, we send a near identical message every time. FOr the client and server, they are as follows. I know they are not very profesional, but they are fun and no end user ever sees them: but I hope they cheer up someone working on an implementation or someone carefully inspecting the packets!

CLIENT: 
```plaintext
Hello server, this is a message to confirm that the quick brown fox jumps over
 the lazy brown dog on your end too. If this is working, reply with my keyword
  "{PICKRANDOM}" so I know it worked!

--- BEGIN MESSAGE SIGNATURE ---

--- END MESSAGE SIGNATURE ---
```

The pickrandom words list is generally every dictionary word in the dictionary for your clients language. It is mostly just a confirmation to make sure the server can actually decrpt it, and can support your languages character set. This message also uses an english panogram to ensure the connection is working.

SERVER: 
```plaintext
Beep Boop, I am a server box. Server to User, please confirm this connection 
works. And yes I can confirm, the fox is jumping over the {keyword}. Over.

--- BEGIN MESSAGE SIGNATURE ---

--- END MESSAGE SIGNATURE ---
```

### Verify bonfire edition

Right after establishing secure channels, we send a CSV file containing all the editions we are willing to communicate using. We then compare, pick the most recent, and send confirmations.

(both) Send list:
```csv
editions
2023
2022-beta
```

Generally we reccommend using the most recent shared version.

### Account

An account stores critical data about a profile such as login and encryption details. An account can have multiple profiles.

### Profile

One account can have multiple profiles, and be switched between freely. The official client also allows you to set diffrent profiles to defult for certain people.

(This document can be minfiied a lot, using [] and {} to elimatye spaces, or minifying spaces and removing comments. And in transit: likely will.)
```yaml
edition: 2023
type: account

public_key: "999b9af08579802c4d1ca35070b179d610754abd2d601284819493a55e9ce760e1bc9b8adc6f9592311546f88f43237c65577ca7db95919945e63bfbb241b7b6"
---
edition: 2023
type: profile

profile: 
    guid: 0000000000000000000000000000000000
    display_name: "String"

    # We reccommend you store the following avatar scales.
    avatar_fullres: https://sub.domain.tld/file/960b70fb405047fd92425f1f3a4b341d.png # If supported by your instance.
    avatar_256: https://sub.domain.tld/file/960b70fb405047fd92425f1f3a4b341d@256.png 
    avatar_128: https://sub.domain.tld/file/960b70fb405047fd92425f1f3a4b341d@128.png 
    avatar_64: https://sub.domain.tld/file/960b70fb405047fd92425f1f3a4b341d@64.png 
    avatar_32: https://sub.domain.tld/file/960b70fb405047fd92425f1f3a4b341d@64.png   # We highly advise against downscaling avatars lower than this.

    pronouns: ["she/they", "she/her", "they/them"]
    # the frist one is shown, then seperated by slashes and when hovered it will show the one at that index
    # So if you have "she/they" and you hover "she" with the array above, it will show a tooltip saying "she/her"

    links: 
    - {
        rel: nofriend, # Unverified
        icon: mastodon,
        handle: "@username@instance.tld",
        link: https://instance.tld/@username,
        visibility: friends
    }
    - {
        rel: me, # Verified
        icon: peertube,
        handle: "@username@instance.tld",
        link: https://instance.tld/@username,
        visibility: everyone
    }

lists: 
    friends: 
        send_messages: true
        see_personal_statuses: true
        
    

    blocked: 
        send_messages: false

    best_friends: 
        display_name: "Best Friends"
        allow_important_messages: true

user_data: 
- { 
    guid: guid,
    group: "group",
    nickname: "nickname",
}

- { 
    guid: guid,
    group: "group",
    nickname: "nickname",
}
```

When mentioning users, any of the following structures can be used, as long as one would bring it down to just one user in the current hub. 

```plaintext
@username
@username@example.net
```

When an account is suspended, all mentions of them should display as `@suspended`. 

Deleted accounts should instead be removed from the database entirely, and their mentions should be replaced with `@unknown`. If they simply moved to another instance, their mentions should update accordingly.

- @**suspended** - A suspended user account. 
- @**unknown** - An unknown user account. 
- @**everyone** - Mentions everyone
- @**someone** - mentions a random person. 

### Messages

A status object can represent a reaction, message, creation, or anything else that is not a `person` or `bot` in nature.

Creation:
```yaml
edition: 2023
type: message
operation: CREATE

language: en # Helps screenreaders pronounce the content.
author: 0000000000000000000000000000000000
adressed: 0000000000000000000000000000000000 # ONE guid. If its a group chat or channel then it will handle more people receving it.
time: 09-04-2023@23:03:01
content: |
"this is the messages content. Some characters need to be escaped."

signature: 2346ad27d7568ba9896f1b7da6b5991251debdf2
```

Editing:
```yaml
edition: 2023
type: message
operation: EDIT

target: 0000000000000000000000000000000000   # What mwessage is being edited?
time: 09-04-2023@23:03:55
content: |
"this is the messages content. I have now edited it. It sends the new exact content, and the server deals with only storing the diffrence."

signature: 2346ad27d7568ba9896f1b7da6b5991251debdf2
```

Removing (HIDING from view, the server won't pass it on, NOT remvoing from servers):
```yaml
edition: 2023
type: message
operation: REMOVE

target: 0000000000000000000000000000000000   # What mwessage is being removed?

signature: 2346ad27d7568ba9896f1b7da6b5991251debdf2
```

Deleting (Removing from servers):
```yaml
edition: 2023
type: message
operation: DELETE

target: 0000000000000000000000000000000000   # What mwessage is being deleted?

signature: 2346ad27d7568ba9896f1b7da6b5991251debdf2
```

### Reactions

Reactions are little emoji counters below a message.

```yaml
edition: 2023
type: message
operation: CREATE # REMOVE removes YOUR reaction. DELETE clears all reactions of that type.

target: 0000000000000000000000000000000000   # Message ID
content: "emoji_shortcode" # No colons around them. If its not a valid emoji, simply drop the packet.

signature: 2346ad27d7568ba9896f1b7da6b5991251debdf2
```

## Formatting and Escapes

Various things need to be replaced for one reason or another. Most important, some characters need to be escaped. 

| Char | Sequence | Reason |
| ---- | -------- | ------ |
| `"`  | `\u0022` | String Closer, would interfere with interchange. |
| `<`  | `\u003c` | Would interfere with embedded objects and allow embedding of HTML. |
| `>`  | `\u003e` | Would interfere with embedded objects and allow embedding of HTML. |
| `&`  | `\u0026` | YAML Reserved Syntax |
| `:`  | `\u003a` | YAML Key Identifier |
| `\`  | `\u005c` | so that `\` can be included in messages without triggering an escape sequnce. |

Other objects, such as @mentions, #channel-mentions, etc must be wrapped in `<>`. This tells the program: "Hey, stop what your doing. I have special instructions for you."

| Type | Replacement | Reason |
| ---- | -------- | ------ |
| `@mention` | `<mention:"guid">` | Allows for refering account data directly, letting mentions get updated as people change usernames. |
| `#channel`  | `<channel:"guid">` | Allows for refering channel data directly, letting mentions get updated as channel names change or get deleted. |

Additionally, in rich status and wiki channels you are able to use the following elements

| Element | Pourpose |
| ---- | -------- |
| `<timer mode="since" start="10-04-2023 17:57:32">` | Often used in rich status to show the time since an action started. |
| `<button text="text" type="type" action="steam://joingame/440/JOIN_SECRET">` | Used for rich status, often for join game buttons. |
| `<duration mode="time" bar_start="0:00" bar_end="2:06" time_start="10-04-2023 17:57:32">` | Used for match duration, health, round completion, etc. |
| `<duration mode="number" bar_start="0" bar_end="300" value="299">` | Used for match duration, health, round completion, etc. |

## Federation

Federation occurs using the packet formats above. When a user wants data, they ask thier instance. Any data thier instance does not have, they ask the instance that will. The instnace that has it then forwards the data directly to the user. No data is stored redundently between instances this way. 

This also makes it possible to delete all messages directly. They MAY still be stored in someones cache, but that will likely be cleared out soon.

## Encryption

The encryption versions, standards, etc are defined by the edition. For this edition, and the forseeable future, we will be using AES with keys established over RSA for all communications. 

If a client or service cannot perform said end to end encryption, we highly reccommend you display a warning stating such.

## Commands
Bonfire has a lot of commands that must or should be built in and supported. Any action that is possible via the UI must be possible via a command. 

Therefore, every implenetation MUST have support for the following commands: 

| Command | Description | 
| ------- | ----------- |
| /invite <span class="violet-2">[duration]</span> <span class="blue-2">[uses]</span> | Invite a user to your hub! |
| /addbot <span class="violet-2">{URI}</span> | Integrate a bot into your hub! | 
| /kick <span class="violet-2">{user}</span> <span class="blue-2">[reason]</span> | Removes a user from your hub or group chat. |
| /ban {user} [reason] [duratation (default: permenent)] | Removes a user from your hub, and prevents them fron returning with a new invite for the specified time. |
| /mute {user} [reason] [duration (defult: 10m)] | Prevents a user in your hub from talking in voice or text chat for the specified time. |
| /quarintine {user} [reason] | prevents a user from seeing any main voice or text channels, and removes all permissions. They can only see rules, server info, and a help channel. Useful for if you believe an account has been compromised.  |
| /role {([add \| remove] {role} {user})| ([create | edit | delete] {role} {paramater} {new_value})} | Manages roles |
| /archive {channel} | Makes a channel read-only and be taken out of the standard channels list. Used for clearing up clutter without deleting history. |
| /nuke {channel} | Clears all messages in a channel. |
| /emote {add \| delete \| edit} {name} (specific cases) | Manages emojis |
| /nick (user) {nick} | Change your or someone elses nicknames. |
