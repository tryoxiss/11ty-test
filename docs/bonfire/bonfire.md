\subtitle: Escape the walled gardens of big tech into a new, always open standard and ecosystem.

// After a big community: 
instances: instance_count;
accounts*: instnaced_total_accounts; 
messages*: instanced_total_messages;
groups*: instanced_total_groups;

* Not every instnace makes thier number of accounts or sent messages public, so this is likely smaller. This number is also only what our instnace federates with or knows about. 

## Designed for YOU

<div class="cards-list">
<div class="postcard">
### Own your data
we store everything in simple and open formats, under our open standard. This makes it easy to switch instances, or self host! On any compliant instnace, you can easily request your data at any time or easily switch to another instnace.

### Always Secure*.
- Always e2e. 
- Good encryption
- Security audited

* For the defult client and implementation. We inherntly cannot control every client or instance, but most clients will warn you when you are talking to someone who might not be secure. 

### Decentralised
Decentralised dosen't necesarly mean crypto bro bullshit. This has none of that. Instances simply communicate with each other despite being on diffrent domains, this is known as federation. Think of it like email: you can send emails to people with adresses at diffrent providers and it works the same as if they were on your own!

- No one person or company owns everything
- Find an instance you trust with your data
- Don't trust any? Self hosting is simple! (The decentralised bit could be its own h2)

## Built for the future
Cards: 
### Using Opem Standards and Technologies
- XMPP for some things
- JSON
- HTTPS
- Our own spec

### No breaking changes
this will work just as well in 20, 30, 40+ years as it does today!

### Login with otgher services


## The transition is easy
Cards: 

### Your friends are already here
Bonfire can easily translate to and from things such as XMPP which means you can **PROBABLY** talk to people on other platforms that support it, such as WhatsApp, Kik, etc. 

### A Familliar Interface
- Simillar to discord by defult
- can be customised to look like iMessage, etc
- or however you want (fully customiseable)!

## Still not convinced? 
Give it a try!
- test without creating an account
