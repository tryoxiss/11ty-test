title: Known Chrome Bugs
---

This is a list of bugs on our website that we know about. We will not fix any chrome specific bugs, ever. Here is why: 

> Google Chrome is destroying the open web. There is no better way to put it. They use thier near-monoply to determine the future of the internet, which often means locoking people specifically to thier services, and thier vision of the internet. 
> 
> I don't think it takes an expert to say that thier vision of the internet is not what most people want, or what would be best for the internet. 
> 
> It's a world where privacy is something only your grandparents remember, a world without adblock, or freedom to do what you will with webpages. A world where only big tech is discoverable or known about. 
> 
> This is why, in an effort to drive people to better, open source, fully capable browsers, like [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) we will never fix any chrome or chromium specific bugs on our website. And if that is the future you truly want, I don't know why you are reading the website of someone to highly advocates for openness, decentralisation, etc.
