These style guidelines help help us make what we do consistant and clear. As part of our focus on accesability, user-friendliness is our guiding force. Our grammar and style rules are based on usability, not always what's "proper". We also did our best to define what everything means. 

## Numerals

Write all numbers numerically, even if its under 10. But if the number starts a scenctence, spell it out. If the number is over 9999, add a space every 3 digits.
