Content on this website is currently all rights reserved unless otherwise specified. However, I do allow reuse with some conditions. 

**Reuse Conditions**
- Content **MUST NOT** be used to train AI or machine learning systems of any kind, for any reason. This includes but is not limited to image recignition, object identification, image generation, neural networks, etc.
- Any reuse must be accompanied by **apropriate credit** and a link to the contents page. Examples of apropriate credit can be found below. 
    - Image by tryoxiss, https://tryoxiss.github.io/gallery/imagename/
    - Image by tryoxiss, [it can be found here](https://tryoxiss.github.io/gallery/imagename/)
    - Post refrenced: Tryoxiss (https://tryoxiss.github.io/posts/example-title/)
- If you are not including content, you are good. That would be something like a link, refrence, citation, etc.
    - Keep in mind while I am very knowlegeable about many of the things I talk about, I may not be the best citation for things where accuracy is of high importance.
- This document is not intended to undermine any versions of fair use.
- You may not claim my content as your own
- Any versions of my content, modified or not, must be shared under the same licence. Exceptions below: 
    - Direct quotes are not included, you can directly quote me without sharing your post under the same licence. If its more than about 20% of the article though, you will need to.
- Do not use my content in any way that you will profit off of without my explicit, written consent. 
    - In this case, "Explicit, written consent" means something very close to me saying "Yes, I consent to you refrencing *[CONTENT]* in your *[WORK]* under *[CONDITIONS]* conditions." If I dont use the word **consent**, then its **NOT CONSENT TO USE MY CONTENT!**
