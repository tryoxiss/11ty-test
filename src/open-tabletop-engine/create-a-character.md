<p>they also assembled it, that was 50$CAD</p>
<p>I use linux, so I didn't get charged for a windows key because I asked them to not include one. If your curious my current distro is <a href="https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/">Fedora Workstation</a> 37</p>

<p>My keyboard is the <a href="https://drop.com/buy/drop-ctrl-mechanical-keyboard?defaultSelectionIds=965751%2C965753">massdrop  CTRL</a>. It's a geat keyboard and works perfectly 99% of the time. Sometimes it has issues connecting to my PC when I restart it (windows linux and mac) but other than that its great!</p>

<p>My mouse is the razer basalisk and it has failed like twice in the year or two that ive had it, I cannot reccommend it so I wont link it. Would not buy another razer product. </p>

<p>I got two monitors off facebook marketplace, they are pretty decent.</p>
