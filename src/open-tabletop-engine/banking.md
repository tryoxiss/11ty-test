*This system is inspired by [Old School RuneScapes note system](https://runescape.fandom.com/wiki/Note)*

You can take any non-unique item to a bank to put them into a note. This note weighs 1g each piece of paper and has no functinality of the normal item. It can be traded at most banks or traders for an equielent item. 

Items that cannot be noted include, but are not limited to Weapons, Armour, Equipment, etc. Items that can be noted are things like herbs, potions, ropes and various supplies, etc. 

The hope is that this system makes encumberment rules more enjoyable to play with.
