Magic in DnD remade is left intentionally open and vaugue, so you can pick and chose what you want to fit it into your world better.

The basic functions of magic are potionmaking, enchanting, and spells. These follow a few basic rules: for example, you cannot enchant anything that is too big or complex, you can enchant a knife or bow but not a gun, train, computer, etc. Where this exact line is drawn is up to you, or remove it entirely if you wish.
