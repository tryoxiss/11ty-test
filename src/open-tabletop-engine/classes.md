Classes refer to diffrent types of characters you can play, such as a bard, wizzard, or bandit. Your class affects your stats and what skills you are likely to have, but is diffrent from race (what species you play as).

Feel free to create your own classes and have fun, but we reccommend you start with these classes as they have been hand picked and balanced to be fun and intereting. Each class has been assigned a few labels about what it does and how they are played, but thats more of a suggestion than any hard rule.

## Devine Classes

[Name WIP] These classes use *someone elses* power to cast spells for thier power, like warlocks (got power loaned to them), paladins and monks (harness thier gods power), etc.

### Monk
<span class="pink-2">Devine</span> <span class="red-2">Fighter</span>

KHAIM: 
Monks are masters of martial arts who use spiritual and physical power to complete their goals
Sounds like a sprititual fighter
so maybe magic fighter
though monk is about a individuals journey of self so it wouldnt fit there very much

### Cleric
<span class="pink-2">Devine</span> <span class="green-2">Healer</span>

### Paladin
<span class="pink-2">Devine</span> <span class="blue-2">Tank</span>

### Warlock
<span class="pink-2">Devine</span> <span class="red-2">Fighter</span>

### Magician
<span class="pink-2">Devine</span> <span class="red-2">Fraudster</span>

## Non-magic classes

Generally less versitle, and generally weaker, but tend to be able to take advantage of enviornments more and are able to work even without mana!

### Archer
<span class="yellow-2">Ranged</span> Something? <span class="yellow-2">(Dexterity)</span>

## Non-offical classes
Untested, unbalanced so far, but fun none the less!

### Trap Rigger
<span class="red-2">Melee</span> <span class="orange-2">Engineer</span>
