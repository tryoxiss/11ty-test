Classes refer to diffrent types of characters you can play, such as a bard, wizzard, or bandit. Your class affects your stats and what skills you are likely to have, but is diffrent from race (what species you play as).

Feel free to create your own classes and have fun, but we reccommend you start with these classes as they have been hand picked and balanced to be fun and intereting. Each class has been assigned a few labels about what it does and how they are played, but thats more of a suggestion than any hard rule.

<!-- TODO: Allow sorting based on attribute! -->
