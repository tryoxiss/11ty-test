**Potions** can be bought and bewed. How effective they are is related to the **size** and **potency** of a potion. It's potency determines rarity, while its size determines the uses before it runs out. Consuming a potion returns the bottle it was in. 

A potions **potency** determines what and how many dice you roll, and its rarity. 
| Tier | Healing | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| <span class="pink-2">Philospiphers (6)</span> | 20d20<sup>(1)</sup> | Legend has it the philosphers stone is created using these very potions. You can likely count on one hand how many exist, and to buy one you may need the capital of a small country! |
| <span class="violet-2">Masterful (5)</span> | 2d12 | Very rare potions that even a master alchemist may only make a handful of times in thier life, and the cost reflects it. |
| <span class="blueviolet-2">Grand (4)</span> | 1d20 | Rare potions only stocked by master alchemists, good in a pinch, but not something you wan't to rely on! |
| <span class="blue-2">Greater (3)</span> | 1d12 | With a large jump in healing, comes a disproportionaly large jump in cost... |
| <span class="green-2">Standard (2)</span> | 1d8 | Likely what you will sustain on for most of your journey, perfectly balancing cost and effectiveness! |
| Lesser (1) | 1d6 | Common potions of little note. |
| <span class="muted">Shoddy (0)</span> | 1d4 | Very... special.. potions. Drink at your own risk! |

And for potion size
| Rarity | Uses | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| <span class="violet-2">Cauldrin</span> | X | Must be bottled before drinking, when bottled it will have uses related to the amount of ingredients you brewed. The longer you brew for, the less uses you get, but the more potent! |
| <span class="blue-2">Large Bottle</span> | 5 | Often used by more experinced parties who can affoard to stock up, this has the best bottle-to-use ratio of them all! |
| <span class="green-2">Bottle</span> | 3 | Common for most adventuers, holds a good number of uses. |
| Jar | 2 | Generally containing more neiche or buff potions, these are a good balance for less common potions! |
| Vile | 1 | One-use potions, often how more rare potions are sold! |

## Types

## Obtaining
Potions can be obtained in a variety of ways, but the most common are below. 

### Brewing Potions
Brewing potions is determined by the ingedients used (*including* its base), time brewed, and a bit more. Potions have the following stats, which are used to determine map coordinates. The potion brewing system is directly based on that found in [Potion Craft](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1210320/Potion_Craft_Alchemist_Simulator/), but highly simplified and designed to work in a TTRPG setting. I don't feel like working on it, so for now take this apprxamte map.

Down: Poison, Earth, Life -->

<!-- And for potion size
| Direction | Effect |
| ---- | ---- |
| Up | Potions with a lot of up tend to give effects such as jump height, speed (attack or movement), etc. |
| Left | The more left a potion is, the hotter it is. Potions with a lot of left tend to give effects such as cold resistance and fire resistance. |
| Right | The more right a potion is determines how cold it is, often giving effects such as increesed endurance.  |
| Down | The more down a potion is | -->
