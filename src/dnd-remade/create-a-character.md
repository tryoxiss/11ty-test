title: dnd remade character creation process
---

Creating a character can be as simple as rolling some dice to get the attributes for a quick game, or a long in-depth process to delicately fine-tune every aspect of them. For this guide, we will look at all the aspects and how we reccommend you decide them. For a more comprehensive guide, see [characters](../characters) and this guide focuses on creating characters.

## Stats

Characters in dndr have a few main stats which determine how they operate in the world. All stats--and levels, go from 1 to 20. With 1 being 5%, and 20 being 100%. 

| Stat | Code | Description | 
| ---- | ---- | --- |
| Strength | STR | Used for feats of strength such as moving rocks, mining, weilding heavy weapondry. This stat measures raw strength. | 
| Dexterity | DEX | This defines more light actions, like pickpocketing, gymnastics, lockpicking, etc. Think of this as sleight of hand | 
| Constitution | CON | This defines determination and persistance. [?] | 
| Intelegence | INT | This defines your characters ability to problem solve and pick up new things. Remember: low intellegnce characters can still be very smart, they just don't excel at problem solving the same way a high intellegnce character might. |
| Knowlege | KNO | This defines how much your character *knows*, not anything about problem solving or picking up information |
| Wisdom | WIS | This defines how perceptive and able to pick up information your character is, not anything about what they know and little about how they problem solve. | 
| Charisma | CHA | This defines how slick your character is with social situations, can they convince a human lie-detector they are a 400 foot tall purple platapus bear with pink hornes and silver wings? Or do you fumble even the simplest interactions? |

- Intelegence
    - Long term intellance
    - may not be the best in the moment, but when they have time to think they can do great things
    - needs time to think
    - Problem solving
- Wisdom 
    - Quick thinking
    - Perception
    - Intuition

There are a few ways to go about assigning your stats, which we will go over as follows. 

### Random Spread <span class="yellow-2">â˜…</span>
This method is reccommended for everyone, especially beginners. Start by rolling either 2d6 (added togehter) or 1d10 for the number of stats you need to assign. Now, you can either assign them in the order you got them for more randomness, or you can assign them to specific stats. One roll per stat. 

This can lead to a lot of bad rolls, which can be punishing to new players, but if you feel your stats are too low you can re-roll them. Although we only reccommend you do this if your sum of all skills is less than 32.

### Value Assignment
This method is suitable for beginers, can can be less punishing as the random spread method, but tends to lead to more boring and samey sames over time. If you use this, it's best to use it sparingly. In this method, you assign the numbers, [11, 7, 6, 6, 4, 2, 1] to your stats as you chose. If you want to avoid the repetivity a little bit, you can use dice to randomly assign them. 

### Points Shop
This method is likely not suitable for beginers, and only amplifies the problems of value assignment. It's main uses are if you want to do a min-maxing game, if your into that. But unless you are proactive about playing a diffrent way each time, this will get stale very quickly.

In this method, you get **41 points** to spend on skills. Each skill costs 1 point. Going past level 6 (7, 8, 9, 10, 11) makes them cost 2 points each. You cannot make a single skill past level 12. This is the exact same sum of points as the value assignment method.
