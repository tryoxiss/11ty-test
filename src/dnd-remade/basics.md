title: DnD Remade Framework
layout: "dndr-framework.njk"
---

This document defines the basic framework and definitions for the rest of the ruleset, which defines spells, mechanics, and more. This is more of a framework that the rest is built on. The other parts can be modified much more easily, but modifying this may break things as it is foundational. 

## Dice

Dice will be defined as `d<sides>` in this document. 

| Dice | Role |
| ---- | ---- |
| d20  | Skill checks, most everything. If in doubt: This is what you probably want |
| d12  | Heavy weapons damage, mostly. Often used to generate times of day, or simillar things. | 
| d10  | Percentile dice, can be used to get a number between 1 and 10 or 1 and 100. | 
| d6   | Commonly used for healing and health related actions | 
| d4   | Aside from being worse to step on than a lego piece, is often used for very light weapons or potion effects. | 

## Item Rarity

The following table has a list of all raritys you are the main tier system. All open for change, in both name color and description. 
| Rarity | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| <span class="pink-2">Mythical</span>  | A one-of-a-kind item or artifcat with one-of-a-kind abbilities and craftsmanship, almost always with magical properties. Often The lifes work of a master craftsperson  |
| <span class="violet-2">Exeedingly Rare</span>  | An incredibly rare item or artifcat with one-of-a-kind abbilities or craftsmanship. Often The lifes work of a master craftsperson  |
| <span class="blueviolet-2">Very Rare</span>  | Can be quite hard to find even with a large amount of buying power to your name, your lucky to have these! |
| <span class="blue-2">Rare</span>  | Somewhat rare, but still often stocked by larger cities if you have the cash for them.  |
| <span class="green-2">Uncommon</span>  | Notable items, but still very common and quite easy to find.   |
| Common | Very common items of little note.  |
| <span class="muted">Junk</span> | Not to say "no use", but these items are rarely useful for much of anything |

These additional raritys also exist for special pourposes, and all combine with it, often taking its color. 

| Rarity | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| <span class="orange-2">Artifact</span>  | A relic of an ancient time, often cursed or highly protected. They have no inherent use, but can often be sold for a very large sum or quest items for high level quests!  |
| Self-Made  | An item your character crated themselves, combined with another rarity and takes its color. For example <span class="blueviolet-2">Self-Made Very Rare</span> |
| <span class="blue-2">Unusual</span>  | Rarer versions of other items, that often have specia lcrafting uses. |

<!-- | <span class="orange-2">Legendary</span>  | An incredibly rare item or artifcat with one-of-a-kind abbilities or craftsmanship. Often The lifes work of a master craftsperson  | -- between mythical and seccond highest-->

The framework is also designed to be mostly or fully compatible with most if not all Dungeons and Dragons homebrew and pre-made campeigns.
