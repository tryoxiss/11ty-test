title: DnD Remade Framework
---

This document defines the basic framework and definitions for the rest of the ruleset, which defines spells, mechanics, and more. This is more of a framework that the rest is built on. The other parts can be modified much more easily, but modifying this may break things as it is foundational. 

## Dice

Dice will be defined as `d<sides>` in this document. 

| Dice | Role |
| ---- | ---- |
| d20  | Skill checks, most everything. If in doubt: This is what you probably want |
| d12  | Heavy weapons damage, mostly. Often used to generate times of day, or simillar things. | 
| d10  | Percentile dice, can be used to get a number between 1 and 10 or 1 and 100. | 
| d6   | Commonly used for healing and health related actions | 
| d4   | Aside from being worse to step on than a lego piece, is often used for very light weapons or potion effects. |
