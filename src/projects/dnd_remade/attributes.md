title: DnD Remade Attributes
---

Attributes are simple tag-based modifiers you can add to any item to modify how it works. If you are looking for stats, or these don't seem what your looking for, see [stats](../stats/).

- ~~Mini crits can be gaurnteed. Crits are random. They do the same damage modifer. It's just to prevent cheese builds.~~
- ~~Struckthrough~~ items are **Marked For Death** and will be **removed or reworked** in a future revision. 

## Baisc Attributes

These attributes do not need to be set when they are just the defult behavour.

    - Defult: Deal 0 damage
- **Consumeable**: This item will be consumed on use. If you want it to return an item, add that as an on-use along with the status effect. for example: drinking a potion returns its bottle as an inventory item.

## Transfer Attributes
These attributes dictate how an item can transfer from one person to another. These probably are not what you are looking for. Not tradeable and not marketable are generally used for quest items, but its generally reccommended you avoid them. They are more a prefab than anything else to prevent players from messing up critical progression.

- **Not Tradeable**: Prohibit this item from being traded to and from NPCs. 
- **Not Marketable**: Prohibit this item from being marketed (sold for gold), to any NPC or shop. 
- **Not Lootable**: Prohibit this item from being pick-pocketed or looted from a corpose. It is reccommended you apply this to all critical items, as it can be frustrating to have it get lost. (Good DMs shouldn't make them get lost *anyway* (unless its a quest!), but it can serve as a nice reminder to that).
- **Soulbound**: Not Tradeable, Not Marketable, Not Lootable. This item will be with you, forever, weather you like it or not. You may be able to find a shaman who can break it, but you risk cursing it in the process!
- **Illegal**: Less NPCs will want to buy it, it is harder to aquire. Don't let the city gaurds find out!

## Misc Attributes

- **Honor Bound**: this item is given to you embues you with pride and honor, you may not know why, but violate its code and you may soon find out.
    - **Honor**: This defines how honor works with that item, it could be something like not hurting a teammate, not putting it away without killing an enemy, taking a life, anything that fits in your world!
    - **On Break Honor**: This defines what happens when the honor code is broken. Is it a bannishment from thier village? Grief? Remorse? Get creative!
